\usage{
dpoig(y, frac, rate, shape, trunc=0, log=FALSE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{y}{
vector of (non-negative integer) quantiles.
}
\item{frac}{
  single numeric '0<frac<=1'; fraction of the population or community sampled (see details)
}
\item{rate}{
  vector of (non-negative) rates of the gamma distribution of the
  sampled population (see details). Must be stricly positive.
}
\item{shape}{
  the shape parameter of the gamma distribution of the
  sampled population (see details).  Must be positive.
}
\item{trunc}{
  truncation point. The most used option is to truncate at zero, since
  species with zero abundance usually are not known. Default value NULL
  means no truncation
}

\item{log}{
  logical; if TRUE, probabilities p are given as log(p)
}
}
\details{
A compound Poisson-gamma distribution is a Poisson probability distribution
where its single parameter, the process mean rate, is frac*n, where n
is a random variable with gamma distribution. The density function
is given by Green & Plotkin (2007) 

In ecology, this distribution gives the probability that a species has
an abundance of x individuals in a random sample of a fraction frac of
the community. In the community the species abundances are independent
random variables that follow an gamma density function.

Hence, a Poisson-gamma distribution is a model for species
abundances distributions (SAD) under the assumptions that (a) species
abundances in the community are independent identically distributed
gamma variables, (b) sampling is a Poisson proccess with expected
value frac*n, (c) the sampling is with replacement, or the fraction
sampled is small enough to approximate a sample with replacement.

The Poisson-gamma distribution is also known as the Negative Binomial
distribution. The function dpoig is provided to express the Negative
Binomial explicity as a compound distribution. The Fisher logseries (Fisher 1943) is a limiting case
where the dispersion parameter of the Negative Binomial tends to zero.
