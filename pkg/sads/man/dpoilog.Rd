\details{
 A compound Poisson-lognormal distribution is a Poisson probability distribution
where its single parameter lambda, is a random variable with lognormal distribution The density function is 

p(x) = (exp(x*mu + x^2*sig/2)*(2*pi*sig)^(-1/2))/x! * g(y)

where g(y) =
int_-infty^infty exp(-exp(y))*exp(((-y-mu-x*sig)^2)/(2*sig)) dy

(Bulmer 1974 eq.5). For x = 0, 1, 2, ... .

In ecology, this distribution gives the probability that a species has
an abundance of x individuals in a random sample of a fraction 'f' of the
community. In the community the species abundances are independent
random variables that follow a lognormal density function, with
parameters (mu + ln(f), sigma) (Engen et al. 2002).

Hence, a Poisson-exponential distribution is a model for species
abundances distributions (SAD) in a sample taken from a community under the assumptions that (a) species
abundances in the community are independent identically distributed
exponential variables, (b) sampling is a Poisson proccess with expected
value E[x]= f*n where n is the abundance in the community and f the
fraction of individuals sampled, (c) individuals are sampled with replacement, or the
fraction of total individuals sampled is small enough to approximate a
sample with replacement. See Engen (1977) and Alonso et al. (2008) for critic evaluations.

\value{
'dpoilog' gives the (log) density of the density, 'ppoilog' gives the (log)
distribution function, 'qpoilog' gives the quantile function.

\source{
  The three functions were built from dpoilog function from poilog
  package (Vidar Grøtan and Steinar Engen).
  
  dpoilog is just a wraper of poilog::dpoilog with an additional 'log' argument.

  ppoilog does the cumulative sum of poilog::dpoilog.

  qpoilog uses the ... method to approximate numerically quantiles using poilog::dpoilog.
