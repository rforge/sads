\arguments{
  \item{y}{
Vector of (non-negative integer) quantiles.
}
\item{frac}{
  Fraction of the population or community sampled (see details)
}
\item{rate}{
  Vector of (non-negative) rates of the exponential distribution of the
  sampled population (see details).
}
\item{log}{
  logical; if TRUE, probabilities p are given as log(p)
}
}
\details{
A compound Poisson-exponential distribution is a Poisson probability distribution
where its single parameter, the process mean rate, is frac*n, where n
is a random variable with exponential distribution. The density function
is

p(y) = rate*frac^y / (frac + rate)^(y+1)

In ecology, this distribution gives the probability that a species has
an abundance of y individuals in a random sample of a fraction frac of
the community. In the community the species abundances are independent
random variables that follow an exponential density function.

Hence, a Poisson-exponential distribution is a model for species
abundances distributions (SAD) under the assumptions that (a) species
abundances in the community are independent identically distributed
exponential variables, (b) sampling is a Poisson proccess with expected
value frac*n, (c) the sampling is with replacement, or the fraction
sampled is small enough to approximate a sample with replacement.
