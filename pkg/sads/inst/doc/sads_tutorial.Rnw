\section*{Warning}
Though this document will hopefully become a comprehensive vignette, currently it is a draft logbook used to clarify some aspects of the theoretical background of this package to developers, and to guide the next steps. 

\section*{Poisson Sample}

Given that there is $n$ individuals of a given species in a community and that a fraction $a$ of these individuals were randomly sampled, the probability of getting $y$ individuals in the sample is given by the Poisson distribution

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:poisson}
f(y)\, = \, \frac{{\left( a\,n\right) }^{y}\,{e}^{-a\,n}}{y!}
\end{equation}

Where the the single parameter of the Poisson $\lambda$ correspond to the expected value $E[y]$ and thus is substituted by the product $a\, n$. Now suppose that the abundance $n$ in the community is also a random variable that can be described by some probability distribution $g(n)$. Then the unconditional probability of getting $y$ individuals in the sample is given by the integral
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:integral}
  h(y) \, = \, \int^{\Omega}f(y)g(n) \, dn \
\end{equation}

Which is the sad model we are looking for. Although there are analytic solutions for many cases, our goal is to write a  \R  function that solves numerically equation \ref{eq:integral} in a generic way, that is, a single function whith an argument for $g(n)$. This function would then allow to compound any probability density function with the Poisson distribution. Taking this generalization further, we can substitute the Poisson distribution by another sampling model, e.g. the negative binomial to model aggregated sampling.

Our first step is to construct a function for a particular case for which the analytical solution is known, which allow us to check the results of the numerical integration.


\subsection*{Compounding with the exponential}

Taking for $g(n)$ the exponential

\begin{equation}
  \label{equation}
  g(n)\, = \, \lambda\,{e}^{-n\,\lambda}
\end{equation}

The equation \ref{eq:integral} solves to:


\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:poiexp}
  h(y) = \frac{\lambda \, a^y}{(a+\lambda)^{y+1}}
\end{equation}

Using logarithms in the intermediary calculations to avoid overflow, we can define this function in \R as

@ 
<<dpoix>>=
dpoix <- function(x, frac, rate, log=FALSE) {
	  b <- x*log(frac)
	  m <- log(rate)
	  n <- (x+1)*log(rate+frac)
          if(log)b+m-n else exp(b+m-n)
        }
@ %def 


The equivalent function for numerical integration in \R is\footnote{This function must be passed to \code{Vectorize} to make \code{integrate} work with more than one  value of \code{y}}:


<<exp>>=
dsad <- Vectorize(FUN=
                  function(y,a,lambda){
                    poi <- function(y,n){
                      w <- y*log(a*n)-lfactorial(y)-a*n
                      exp(w)
                    }
                    f1 <- function(n){
                      dexp(n,rate=lambda) * poi(y,n)
                    }
                    integrate(f1,0,Inf, abs.tol = .Machine$double.eps^0.25/1000000)$value
                  },
                  "y")
@ %def 

The functions seems to give the same results

@ 
<<tests>>=
dsad(0:10,a=0.1,lambda=0.01)
dpoix(0:10,frac=0.1,rate=0.01)
@ %def 

But as the value of $y$ increases the numeric solution goes to zero. This effect is circumvented by the argument \code{abs.tol}, but it is not yet solved for small values of \code{frac} and \code{rate}, e.g.
@ 
<<tests2>>=
dsad(c(200,20000),0.1,0.00001)
dpoix(c(200,20000),0.1,0.00001)
@ 
The figure \ref{fig:fig1} shows that this effect occurs even for moderate values of $\lambda$. The next step is to investigate this, and to correct the numerical integration.

<<echo=FALSE>>=
x <- 0:50
y1 <- dpoix(x,0.01,0.001)
y2 <- dsad(x,0.01,0.001)
@

\end{figure}

\subsection*{Numerical integration}

The first step on investigating this integration is verify the details of the \code{integrate} function. 
From the R-help of the function, we find that it implements the adaptative quadrature method. Additionally to the 
expression being integrated and the limits of integration, \code{integrate} also allow to specify the absolute(\code{abs.tol}) and relative 
(\code{rel.tol}) accuracy of the function used to approximate the integrand.\footnote{
http://www.amtp.cam.ac.uk/lab/people/sd/lectures/nummeth98/integration.htm}

As was said above, the numeric solution goes to zero as the value of \code{y} increases. And this effect is circumvented specifying a value 
for \code{abs.tol}. Although this approach conduct to a numerical result equivalent to the one otained analytically, it is easily found that for ranges(of the parameter  \code{y} and the values of \code{frac} and \code{rate}) out of the considerated, then the explicit definition of \code{abs.tol} does not help at all. Alternativaly, a similar effect is observated when modifying the upper limit of integration and it is interesting to note that the effects are observated even for wide ranges of the parameters. May be the change on \code{abs.tol} induct a modification in the numerial estimation of \code{Inf}  \footnote{http://en.scientificcommons.org/43526693}.

\subsubsection*{A first guess on replace \code{Inf}}

We now propose another way to circumvent the problem, it consist in manipulate the upper limit of integration \code{Inf}. Such procedure is not recommended according to R-help but for our purposes it seems to produce good results.

With a few trials we found that substitutig \code{Inf} by particular values, this can make the numerical solution matches the anlytical. It is observated that increasing the upper limit, when \code{frac} and \code{rate} are getting lower,  conduct to better aproximation of the numerical integration. Considering $\code{frac}=10^{-1}$ and $\code{rate}=10^{-5}$, with $200 \leq \code{y} \geq 20000$, a reasonably good choice is replace \code{Inf} by \code{k*y/(a+lambda)} with \code{k=1.9920941}. Figure \ref{fig:fig1} shows the analytical and numerical curves visually matching. Figure \ref{fig:fig0} is the result when integral is calculated with \code{abs.tol}.

\end{figure}

<<echo=false>>=
dsad <- Vectorize(FUN=
                  function(y,a,lambda){
                    poi <- function(y,n){
                      w <- y*log(a*n)-lfactorial(y)-a*n
                      exp(w)
                    }
                    f1 <- function(n){
                      dexp(n,rate=lambda) * poi(y,n)
                    }
						k <- 1.9920941
						integrate(f1,0,k*y/(a+lambda))$value
                  },
                  "y")
@

\begin{figure}
  \label{fig:fig2}
  \begin{center}
<<echo=false, fig=TRUE>>=
x <- 200:20000
frac <- 10^-1
rate <- 10^-5
y1 <- dpoix(x,frac,rate)
y2 <- dsad(x,frac,rate)
plot(x,y1, xlab="y", ylab="prob", ylim=range(c(y1,y2)), cex=0.8)
points(x,y2,pch=3,cex=0.5, type="b")
legend("topright", c("analytical","numeric"), pch=c(1,3))
@ %def
\end{center}
\caption{Probability value returned by the function \code{dpoix}, which calculates the Poisson-exponential analytically and the function \code{dsad}, which calculate the compound distribution by numerical integration.}
\end{figure}

In the above case the value of \code{k} was manually tunned, hopefully giving exact results for:

<<tests2>>=
dsad(c(200,20000),0.1,0.00001)
dpoix(c(200,20000),0.1,0.00001)
@

For ranges out of the cited above, then the value of \code{k}, or even the entire solution, may be defined more consistently. This result can be improved, for wide ranges of \code{frac}, \code{rate} and \code{y}, if we specify 
the upper limit of integration in an another alternative manner. This time the idea is to split the total range of any parameter, \code{y} for 
example, in two or more parts and then specify the numerical integration for each part. The updated function for numerical integration is below.

<<exp>>=
dsad <- Vectorize(FUN=
                  function(y,a,lambda){
                    poi <- function(y,n){
                      w <- y*log(a*n)-lfactorial(y)-a*n
                      exp(w)
                    }
                    f1 <- function(n){
                      dexp(n,rate=lambda) * poi(y,n)
                    }
					if (y<10){
						integrate(f1,0,100/max(a,lambda))$value
					}else if (y<50){
						k <- 6
						integrate(f1,0,k*y/(a+lambda))$value
					}else{
						k <- 1.9920941
						integrate(f1,0,k*y/(a+lambda))$value
					}
                  },
                  "y")
@ %def

The above expression is an attempt to correct the result from the numerical  integration provided by the standart \code{integrate} R function. The limits for each \code{y} intervals were selected as example.

In fact, this is not a final solution yet. Both curves do not match for $\code{rate}=10^{-6}$\ and\ $\code{frac}=10^{-1}$, for example, as shows the graph of Figure \ref{fig:fig3} below:

\begin{figure}
  \label{fig:fig3}
  \begin{center}
<<echo=false,fig=TRUE>>=
x <- 0:20000
frac <- 10^-1
rate <- 10^-6
y1 <- dpoix(x,frac,rate)
y2 <- dsad(x,frac,rate)

\subsection*{Some aspects of the numerical integration}

Given that \code{frac} is a fraction of the total number of individuals of the comunity, that was included in the sample. This give us a upper limit on the horizontal axis and consequently an upper limit for the integration \code{y=1/frac}.

Also, independently of the limit of integration, the integral of the function for that interval must be 1. This aspects are verified:

\begin{figure}
  \label{fig:fig4}
  \begin{center}
<<fig=TRUE>>=
frac <- 10^-5
rate <- 10^-5
x <- 0:(1/frac)
y1 <- dpoix(x,frac,rate)
y2 <- dsad(x,frac,rate)
plot(x,y1, xlab="y", ylab="prob", ylim=range(c(y1,y2)), cex=0.8)
points(x,y2,pch=3,cex=0.5, type="b")
legend("topright", c("analytical","numeric"), pch=c(1,3))
